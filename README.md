Context
-------

This project's goal is to create a (simplified) clone of _Final Fantasy_'s combat, a game developed
by [_Square Enix_](https://www.square-enix.com)
Broadly speaking for the combat the player has a group of characters to control and a group of
enemies controlled by the computer.

Code changes:
* Created an `AbstractMagicWielder` class to generalize `Mages` and `Black Mages`.
* Modified `toString` methods in child classes to reuse the code from parents. It gets the class name at runtime to improve
